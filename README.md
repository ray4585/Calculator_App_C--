# Calculator_App_C++
 basic calculator program
When I approach programming I try to break everything I do out into steps it seems to help move from one thing to the next within the project but also helps
so you don't get to far past an error and have to go all the way back and all that code you added on top is now usually useless. To be a good team member within software developement is usually the difference between a sucessful project and a failure, to be a good team member in my opinion means to be able to be relied upon in my opinion. I have looked forward to creating a Github portfolio with all my code for a while now and I look forward to adding the other project from this term shortly. Thank you for being a great supportive teacher!!!
